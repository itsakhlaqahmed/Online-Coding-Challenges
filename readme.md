# Hello Fam!

## It is repo which contains my solutions to some of the coding challenges

They are surely not all of them. I'll try to group them and upload them in this repo.
Most (almost all) of the challenges are solved using Python. 
I know a couple of more languages like Java, Javascript etc too, with Python you get to focus more on the problem
and its solution unlike other languages like Java where you syntax is also a problem.

Online Challenges are always fun and helpful
